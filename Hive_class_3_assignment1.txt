POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
  insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
Ans: select  year_id, sum(sales) as Total_Sales  from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
Ans: select * from sales_order_orc s1 where s1.quantityordered IN (select max(s2.quantityordered) from sales_order_orc s2);

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
Ans: select qtr_id, sum(sales) as Total_Sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
Ans: select s1.qtr_id, s1.year_id, s1.sales from sales_order_orc s1 where s1.sales in (select min(s2.sales) from sales_order_orc s2);

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
Ans:  
    select s1.country, s1.sales from sales_order_orc s1
    where s1.sales in
    (
    select max(s2.sales) from sales_order_orc s2
    union all
    select min(s3.sales) from sales_order_orc s3
    );
  
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
Ans: select city, qtr_id, sum(sales) as Total_Sales from sales_order_orc group by city,qtr_id sort by city,qtr_id;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
Ans: select s1.year_id, s1.month_id, max(s1.quantityordered) as max_order from
sales_order_orc s1 
group by s1.year_id, s1.month_id;
